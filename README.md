# Rock Paper Scissors

Here's a rock paper scissors game played in the console.
This project is to demonstrate my javascript skills as taught to me by The Odin Project.

# How To Play

- Click on this [link](https://sologudlyf.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) to see the live preview of this repo

- Open the developer console (ctrl + shift + j in chrome)

- Now read and provide your choice as indicated by the prompt on the page. You get to play against computer who makes his choice randomly. I employed the javascript in built function Math.random() in doing that.

- Happy Gaming ðŸ˜Š!
